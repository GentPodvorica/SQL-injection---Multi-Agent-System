SQL Injection Exploitation with Multi-Agent Systems

This project uses Python and multi-agent systems to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web pages. Key features include:

Vulnerability Detection: Automated scanning of web pages for SQL injection points.
Exploit Automation: Coordinated agent-driven attacks to demonstrate SQL injection impacts.
Collaborative Intelligence: Multi-agent systems working together for efficient and scalable exploitation.

Built for ethical hacking and cybersecurity awareness, emphasizing the importance of securing applications against SQL injection threats.
